## 📌 **Overview**
**Quality.ai**, together with **CargoFirst**, is building the next-generation AI ecosystem for automated agricultural commodity inspection and real-time grading systems.  
This repository contains foundational analytical notebooks for understanding the **behavior, characteristics, and dataset patterns** of various commodities — currently **Chickpea, Rice, and Wheat**.

The insights derived here directly support our product direction for scalable **AI-powered quality analysis**, contributing to defect detection, grading standards, and model development.

---

## 🎯 **Project Scope & Purpose**
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and statistical understanding of commodity datasets.
- Study grain properties to inform ML feature extraction and dataset patterns.
- Build references for scalable dataset pipelines for advanced ML models.
- Support Quality.ai’s real-time automated inspection products.

This research layer acts as the foundation for integrating datasets into **YOLOv8-based inference models**, automated grading systems, and real-time vision pipelines.

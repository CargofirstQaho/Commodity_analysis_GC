## 📌 **Overview**
**Commodity Analysis GC** is a data-analysis project focusing on agricultural commodity datasets — currently analyzing **Chickpea**, **Rice**, and **Wheat**.  
The notebooks demonstrate a complete end-to-end workflow including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and comparative insights for commodity behavior.

The project acts as a structured, reproducible and extendable reference for students, researchers, developers working on agricultural economics and commodity-trend analysis.

## 🎯 **Objectives**
- Understand commodity-market patterns and agricultural trends
- Perform statistical and visual analysis for better interpretation
- Provide reusable notebook templates for commodity comparisons
- Demonstrate clean and replicable workflow using Python
